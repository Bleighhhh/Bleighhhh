- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bleighhhh
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux, new tech and management. That is not completely true since I am also into spirituality, music and ancient cultures. I do not know how to code but I will learn and apply it for good societal change.I like it open-source btw
- 🌱 I’m currently learning (I would like to learn is more correct): Haskell and Rust.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Linux apps and dotfiles.
